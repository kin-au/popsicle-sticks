# Popsicle Sticks - a random name picker

#### As it says on the box; a little tool to draw a name from a hat.

During my time at [FAC](https://www.foundersandcoders.com), we would randomly select a "volunteer" to showcase their work. This was done by picking a popsicle stick from a pot - each stick with one of our names written on it. This app is the COVID-compliant version of that.

##### Technical goals:

- Learn to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) with [React](https://reactjs.org)

##### User stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to search/select a GitHub username or organisation to add usernames to a visible list
- As a user, I want to be able to modify this list by adding (via the same search feature) or removing individual GitHub usernames
- As a user, I want to click a button to randomly select one of the Github usernames from the list, and see the selected user
- As a user, I want to toggle an option to remember the Github usernames that have already been randomly selected
- As a user, I want to be able to reset the current list of Github usernames
- As a user, I want to be able to remove the current list of Github usernames, returning to the home page search/select feature
- As a user, I want to interact with a device responsive and intuitively designed interface
- As a user, I want to be able to toggle between light:full_moon:/dark:new_moon:/rainbow:rainbow: theme
